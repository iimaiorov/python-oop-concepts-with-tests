# Python OOP Concepts with Tests

## Project Description

This project demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It includes examples of creating classes, methods, inheritance, encapsulation, and other OOP principles. The project also contains tests to ensure the correctness of these implementations.

## Key Features

1. **Class Creation**:
   - Examples of defining classes and objects.

2. **Methods and Attributes**:
   - Implementation of methods, including static, class, and instance methods.

3. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**:
   - Examples of class inheritance and polymorphism.

4. **Testing**:
   - Tests to verify the functionality of the classes and methods.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iimaiorov/python-oop-concepts-with-tests.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd python-oop-concepts-with-tests
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Review the scripts to understand OOP principles in Python.
- Run the tests to verify the functionality:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

## Project Structure

- **models/**: Directory containing classes and models demonstrating OOP concepts.
- **tests/**: Directory containing tests for verifying the OOP implementations.
